This is the code for "Combinatorial optimization for low bit-width neural networks"(https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02006.pdf).
#### Demos for single layer network
The following examples generate Figure 3 (a) binary weights and (b) ternary weights in our paper.
```bash
cd singleLayer
python demo1.py
python demo2.py
```
#### Demos for two-layer networks and MLP models
```bash
cd singleLayer
python demo1.py
python demo2.py
```
